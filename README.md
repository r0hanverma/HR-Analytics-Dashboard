# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
I visualized HR Analytics Dashboard on Tableau analyzing KPI's and insights like : 
Attrition by gender
Department-wise attrition
Field-wise attrition
Attrition rate by gender for different groups

These insights derived from HR analytics can empower organizations to make data-driven decisions, enhance employee satisfaction and productivity, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately contribute to achieving business objectives.
